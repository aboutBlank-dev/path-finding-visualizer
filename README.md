## Path Finding Visuazlier
Path Finding Visualizer made using React(vite) and minimal Tailwind.

For an extra "challenge" I decided to make it using the HTML Canvas component since all other solutions I have seen tend to opt for a grid component with CSS.

## Features
- Make your own Grid (Place Start, End(Goal) and Obstacle Nodes.
- Adjust Grid Size and Simulation(Visualization) speed.
- Choose which path finding algorithm you want to visualize (DFS, BFS, A*, etc)
- Generate a random maze which uses the [Recursive Backtracking Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_backtracker)
